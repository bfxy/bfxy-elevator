A pseudo user guide for a basic elevator
########################################


What is this?
----------------------

This is a user guide sample that I did for a job interview at Kaspersky Lab in Moscow.

The task was to write a simple and jolly user guide for a common modern elevator, as if it was just invented and no one knows how to use it. I barely used any technical references (maybe some vocabulary) to keep the guide genuine and to preserve some artistic tone over it. 

All of the information in the guide is fully based on personal experience with elevators, so it definitely should not be considered a legitimate reference, and hence must not be relied on in a real-life situation.

Why is this here?
-----------------

I wanted to try out Sphinx and this seemed to be a good excersice. Also I like the result and wish to share it just for fun or whatever you may find it useful for.

Enjoy.
