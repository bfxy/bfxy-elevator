A pseudo user guide for a basic elevator
########################################


What is this?
----------------------

This is a work sample of a user guide that I did for a job interview at Kaspersky Lab in Moscow. 

The task was to write a simple and friendly user manual for a standard human-carrying elevator as if it was just invented and no one knows how to use it.

Why is this here?
-----------------

I wanted to try out Sphinx and this seemed to be a good excersice, and also I like what I've done and wish to share it just for lolz or whatever you may find it useful for.

Enjoy.
