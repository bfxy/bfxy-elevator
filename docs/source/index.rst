A pseudo user guide for a basic elevator
########################################


What is this?
----------------------

This is a sample of a user guide that I did for a job interview at Kaspersky Lab in Moscow. 

The task was to write a simple and jolly user manual for a standard human-carrying elevator as if it was just invented and no one knows how to use it. I barely used any technical references (maybe some vocabulary) to keep the guide genuine and to preserve some artistic tone over it. 

All of the information in the guide is 100%-based on personal experience with elevators, so it definitely should not be considered a real user guide and thus should not be relied on in a real-life situation.

Why is this here?
-----------------

I wanted to try out Sphinx and this seemed to be a good excersice. Also I like the result and wish to share it just for lolz or whatever you may find it useful for.

Enjoy.
