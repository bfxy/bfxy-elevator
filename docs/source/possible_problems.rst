Possible problems
=================

The elevator maintenance is only performed by authorized professionals. If you suspect a fault, do not hesitate to call (555)-ELEVATE and report the problem to the operator. You can also address the issue to the building administrators or security officers.

In case you encounter the fault while inside the elevator, please follow the emergency procedures.

Emergency
---------

.. IMPORTANT:: 
   In any case of emergency, do not panic! Your safety is 100%-ensured if you stay calm and follow the simple      instructions provided below. Panicking provokes unpredictable behavior that can lead to a longer evacuation.

Unfortunately there are situations in which the elevator may suddenly fail to function properly. In most cases the elevator will stop at nearest floor and let the passengers out. However, the elevator may also stuck between the stories. Such situation requires an assisted evacuation performed by a team of professionals.

Alarm
^^^^^

In case of fire or earthquake alarm, the elevator will automatically switch to the emergency mode that commands it to stop by the nearest story and open the doors. At this point, each passenger is required to abandon the elevator. The elevator will render out of operation.

Follow general evacuation instructions to exit the building.

Breakdown
^^^^^^^^^

In case of a fault to the mechanics or the electronic control system, the elevator will try to switch to the emergency mode. However, it is possible that the blocking mechanism will be set on and the elevator will become stuck.

Stay calm and try to reach the operator over the speaker and call for the assisted evacuation.
If you are stuck inside with a company, try to calm down everyone who shows any signs of panic or visible disturbance. Stay positive and encourage people into conversations. Be ironic about the situation or sing a funny song. This can cool off the stress and help to pass the time.

Follow the required procedure to call help and patiently await the assistance.

Evacuation
^^^^^^^^^^

Do not attempt to exit the carriage or climb inside a shaft at any costs. The carriage is the safest place to stay at any moment. Wait for the evacuation team to arrive. The assisted evacuation is only performed by qualified public-safety professionals who will pull you out safe and sound. Be open to communicate with the evacuation team as your actions may be also required.

Remember, patience is a virtue.

Health Issues
-------------

An elevator ride almost never causes serious motion sickness or related symptoms. However, a full-height travel up a skyscraper involves undergoing dramatic acceleration and some symptoms may arise in inexperienced passengers. In this case, press the Stop button and exit the elevator. 

Do not be confused or ashamed about the situation. Have a 1â€“3 minute break and continue the ride. The symptoms will likely wear off in a couple of minutes. Remember, your body needs some time to adjust to the new experience. You may take a couple more rides if you feel it may help the body to adapt faster.
