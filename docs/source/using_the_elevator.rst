Using the elevator
==================

Using the elevator is as straightforward and inherent as doing any other everyday routine. You only have to know you destination story, and to be a little patient to wait for an elevator on busy days.

General safety
--------------
As much as an imponderable joy to experience, the elevator is not a place to play. That being said, using the elevator requires certain responsibility to acknowledge and a list of rules to follow.

Do’s and don’ts
---------------

The rules of using an elevator are simple and do not require memorization as most of them will be followed intuitively. However, pay attention to them for once and especially do not overlook those applied if you are accompanied by a child or a baby.

.. NOTE:: 
   **The elevator is a smoking-free area**


DO NOT
WHY
Use the elevator if it looks or sounds faulty.
You may be correct. Call the operator for the inspection and use another elevator or the stairs.
Hold the doors open with your body parts.
Stay away from the gap between doors as this is a danger zone. There is a special button on control panel to hold the doors.
Try to open doors while moving.
The emergency mechanism will block the elevator and it will stuck.
Smoke or set fire inside.
The sensors will trigger the fire alarm.
Randomly hit buttons on the control panel.
This may damage the electronics and lead to a breakdown.
Jump or lift yourself up inside.
The weight sensor will fail to detect your presence inside and stop the elevator.
Express frustration and outrage by hitting walls and doors.
Any damage done to the elevator may result in arrest and legal proceeding. Also, the sensors may trigger the earthquake alarm. 
Also travel carefully under influence of alcohol or other substances as the elevator may fly into space and never return back. Jokes aside, be responsible and seek for assistance if you feel you may need any. 

Operation
---------

Call
^^^^

Stand in front of the elevator doors. The display will indicate the story, that the elevator is currently on or passing by.

Press the Call button. The button will light up, which means that you have called the elevator. Be patient as sometimes the elevator will stop to pick up passengers on its way.

When the elevator arrives, you will hear a clinging sound. The doors will open and you will be welcome on board.

Travel
^^^^^^

When the doors are open, first let out the exiting passengers if there are any. Do not be afraid that the doors will shut before letting you in — the sensors will make sure you have enough time. However, do not hesitate to enter the elevator either. Wait for too long and the doors will shut anyway. In this case you have to press the Call button once again to open the doors.

Once inside, you will see a control panel on the wall. Press the desired story button and wait for the doors to shut. During ascent (or descent) you may feel a slight dizziness. This is a completely normal human vestibular system response to the acceleration. The elevator may come in a very exotic experience to your body at first, so give it some time to adjust.

During the travel the elevator may stop to pick up more passengers. Pay attention to the display, which indicates the story, so you do not miss your exit.

Stop & change Story
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Press the Stop button to stop and exit the lift. The elevator will always stop on the nearest level and open doors. You do not have to exit the elevator at this point if you are willing to go to another story. Press the desired story button and the elevator will take you there.

Exit
^^^^

You will again hear a clinging sound upon arrival. Look at the display to make sure you have arrived on the correct story. Wait for doors to open and exit the elevator. Again, do not worry you will not have enough time to step out. The elevator will simply halt and wait for you actions if your exit takes too long.
