General information
===================

An elevator is a vertical transportation device, designed to move people between the building stories (levels). Elevators are commonly built inside middle- to high-rise buildings, where climbing stairs up to the top stories may demand a physical challenge. Modern elevators are powered by electric motors and are able to transport people for more than ten stories up or down in a matter of several seconds.

Purpose of use
--------------

An elevator is the most efficient way of transportation within the building. Elevators can carry both people and cargo to as high as 150 stories at the tallest buildings in the world. Elevators are easily controlled and require little to no technical knowledge. Using a modern elevator is a completely safe procedure.

Design and function
-------------------

A modern elevator is a complicated mechanism, however based on the simple physical principle. The typical elevator construction includes:

* a passenger carriage
* an electric motor
* a control system

Carriage
^^^^^^^^

A passenger carriage operates inside a shaft. A shaft is usually engineered prior to the building construction. A shaft is designed to have slightly wider dimensions than the carriage to allow installing emergency equipment and performing maintenance. A shaft typically stretches to full the height of the building. 

A shaft has a pair of doors on each story to prevent passengers from falling down the shaft. A carriage has its own set of doors, which only operates simultaneously with the shaft doors.

A carriage allows to travel only limited number of people at the same time. Any overweight is harmful to the mechanism of the elevator and is prevented by an automatic control system, which will refuse to move the carriage.

Motor
^^^^^

An electric motor is installed on the very top of the shaft. A carriage is connected to a counterweight via a steel rope mounted over a sheave (a pulley). The sheave is driven by an electric motor and provides traction to a carriage with a counterweight. Such type of mechanism is often referred to as a traction elevator.

Control system and automation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any modern elevator operation is controlled by an automatic electronic control system. The control system provides functions of carrying passengers to a specified story, opening and closing doors, entering emergency mode and providing emergency devices inside the carriage.

Any passenger carriage features a control panel on one of its inner walls. The control panel has several buttons designating each story and auxiliary buttons to stop the elevator, to hold the doors open and to call the operator over a speaker in case of emergency. The control panel may also feature a display to indicate the story the elevator is passing by. The same display may appear on each story of the building outside the elevator.

Modern elevator carriage is filled with all sorts of sophisticated technology to ensure passengersâ€™ safety. This includes weight and movement sensors, responsive behavior to fire and earthquake alarm, automatic evacuation algorithm, blocking mechanisms in case of breakdown, communication devices for calling help.
