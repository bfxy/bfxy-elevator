General information
===================

An elevator is a vertical transport device designed to move people between the building stories (floors, levels). Elevators are commonly built inside middle- to high-rise buildings, where climbing the stairs up to the top story may demand a physical challenge. Modern elevators are powered by electric motors that allow to transport people for more than ten stories up or down in a matter of several seconds.

Purpose of use
--------------

An elevator is the most efficient way of transportation within the building. Elevators can carry both people and cargo to as high as 150 stories in the tallest buildings in the world. Elevators are easily controlled and require little to no technical knowledge. Using a modern elevator is a completely safe procedure.

Design and function
-------------------

A modern elevator is a complicated mechanism however based on the simple physical principle. The design of a modern elevator includes:

* Passenger carriage
* Electric motor
* Control system

Carriage
^^^^^^^^

A passenger carriage operates inside a shaft. A shaft is usually engineered prior to the building construction. A shaft is designed to have slightly wider dimensions than the carriage to allow installing emergency equipment and performing maintenance. A shaft typically stretches to the full height of a building. 

A shaft has a pair of doors on each story to prevent unlucky accidents. A carriage has its own set of doors that only operate synchronously with the shaft doors.

A carriage allows only limited number of people to travel at the same time. Any overweight is harmful to the mechanism of an elevator, and thus is prevented by an automatic control system that will refuse to close doors and to continue the travel.

Motor
^^^^^

An electric motor is usually installed at the very top of a shaft. A carriage is connected to a counterweight via a steel rope mounted over a sheave (a pulley). A sheave is driven by an electric motor and provides traction to a carriage with a counterweight. This type of mechanism is often called a traction elevator.

Control system and automation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any modern elevator operation is controlled by an automatic electronic control system. The control system provides several functions:

* carries passengers to a specified story
* opens and closes doors 
* triggers emergency mode
* provides emergency devices inside a carriage

Any passenger carriage features a control panel on one of its inner walls. The control panel has several buttons designating each story and auxiliary buttons that can stop the elevator, hold the doors open, and call the operator over a speaker in case of emergency. A control panel may also feature a display to indicate the story that the elevator passes by. Same display may appear on each story of a building outside the elevator.

Modern elevator carriage is filled with all sorts of sophisticated technology to ensure passengersâ€™ safety. This includes weight and movement sensors, responsive behavior to fire and earthquake alarm, automatic evacuation algorithms, blocking mechanisms in case of a breakdown, communication devices for calling help.
